Question 1: Explain this following bash script:

#!/bin/bash
space_free=$( df -h | awk '{ print $5 }' | sort -n | tail -n 1 | sed 's/%//' )
case $space_free in
[1-5]*)
echo Plenty of disk space available
;;
[6-7]*)
echo There could be a problem in the near future
;;
8*)
echo Maybe we should look at clearing out old files
;;
9*)
echo We could have a serious problem on our hands soon
;;
*)
echo Something is not quite right here
;;

solution:

#!/bin/bash
# Print a message about disk useage.
space_free=$( df -h | awk '{ print $5 }' | sort -n | tail -n 1 | sed 's/%//' )
#So in the line above we store the disk usage value in space_free
#df -h list the information about disk usage 
#we pass the value of df -h to 'awk' so  for each line in df -h
#it get splitted and the fifth element  is printed and the 
#all the values are passed to 'sort -n'.
#With sort -n we sort the value from 0 to highest (ascendent order)
#Now we pass the values to 'tail -n 1' and we get the last value (-
#n 1). Now we pass the value to sed 's/%//' and remove % sign.-> 
#89% becomes 89. Now the value is stored in space_free variable.
case $space_free in
   [1-5]) # we check if the value is between 10 to 5x we echo
      echo Plenty of disk space available
   ;;
   [6-7]) # we check if the value is between 60 to 7x we echo
      echo There could be a problem in the near future
   ;;
   8) # we check if the value is between 80 to 8x we echo
      echo Maybe we should look at clearing out old files
   ;;
   9) # we check if the value is between 90 to 9x we echo
      echo We could have a serious problem on our hands soon
   ;;
   *)# if up conditions don't match we echo
      echo Something is not quite right here
   ;;
